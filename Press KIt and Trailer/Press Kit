For the Final Project, we decided to recreate the existing game, Robbie Swifthand and the Orb of Mysteries, which is a 2D action puzzle video game originally 
developed by Greek studio Pixel Reign. In this game, the player needs to control a thief  who is told by a spirit that he has to save humanity from a demonic 
presence. And there are lots of both hidden and obvious obstacles and weapons 
like axes to stop the player to get to the final destination.

Beyond the original levels, we add more levels and obstacles to the game to upgrade and differentiate our game from the original version. In these new levels, 
you will face more challenges and experience more fun stuff.

Imagine how excited that you can be the hero to save the whole of humanity and escape from the dangerous temple! Please enjoy our game and have a wonderful 
adventure!
